# Status Overview Panel

Status Overview Panel is an ideological continuation of the Status Panel plugin, written on the latest framework supported by Grafana.
The plugin's task is to display the worst status of any component based on various metrics or one of the metrics of that component.
In this context, the component can be any server, application, IT system, or anything else you can think of, combining metrics into a single entity.
The main feature of the plugin is the visual representation of the component's status changes.
We achieve this with a large panel displaying the component's name, the display of all metrics or metrics influencing the status change, as well as a flashing effect when the status changes.
Audio notifications are also planned for the future.

## Key Features
- Display the worst status of components based on various metrics
- Per-rule unit formatting options for proper display of different data types
- Enhanced field configuration for proper formatting of time-based metrics
- Visual representation of status changes with flashing effects
